# super keyword -->
# used to give access to methods and properties of a parent class from within a child class.
# useful when a class inherits from multiple parent classes and you want to call a method from one of the parent classes.

# Creates a proxy object Lets you call methods from a parent class without naming it directly.
# Used to call parentâ€™s methods Most often __init__() but also useful for other methods.
# Supports code reuse Avoids rewriting shared logic in child classes.
# Works with multiple inheritance Python uses MRO (Method Resolution Order) to decide which method gets called.
# Cleaner and maintainable Keeps your code modular and avoids hardcoding class names.
